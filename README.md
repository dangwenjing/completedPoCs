# Enhanced PoC Dataset for Security Research
This repository hosts a curated collection of high-quality Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits.
Each PoC has been verified, standardized, and enriched through a multi-source fusion process combining data from platforms such as ExploitDB, Seebug, CXSecurity, and Packet Storm, as well as official CVE entries.

# Usage:
Researchers can reference or reproduce vulnerabilities with consistent metadata.
Security communities may link these PoCs to GitHub Advisory or CVE records for validation and traceability.

# Ethical Consideration:
This project is solely focused on improving the quality and reproducibility of existing public Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits through multi-source fusion and data enhancement techniques.
We developed tools and methods to standardize, enrich, and validate already published PoCs in order to support downstream security applications, vulnerability remediation, and academic research.

We do not create, publish, or distribute any new exploit code or undisclosed vulnerabilities. All PoCs included or referenced in this repository are derived from publicly available sources (e.g., ExploitDB, Seebug, Packet Storm, NVD/CVE). So our project will not lead to extra harm.
