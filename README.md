# Enhanced PoC Dataset for Security Research
This repository hosts a curated collection of high-quality Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits.
Each PoC has been verified, standardized, and enriched through a multi-source fusion process combining data from platforms such as ExploitDB, Seebug, CXSecurity, and Packet Storm, as well as official CVE entries.

# Usage:
Researchers can reference or reproduce vulnerabilities with consistent metadata.
Security communities may link these PoCs to GitHub Advisory or CVE records for validation and traceability.
